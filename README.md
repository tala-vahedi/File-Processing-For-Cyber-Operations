Hashing Files for Forensics

The File Hashing for Forensics .py file uses the os library and the os.walk() method to create a list of all files, iterate through the list of files and calculate the md5 hash of each file. Finally, it will create a dictionary entry where the key = md5 hash and the value = filepath.

The File Processing for Worms .py file reads the 'redhat.txt' log file that includes windoes logs generated from RedHat. After iterating through each word in the logfile, the script generates a unique list of words, sorts them in alphabetical order, and prints out log events where worms were present.
