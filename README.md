Hashing Files for Forensics

The File Hashing for Forensics .py file uses the os library and the os.walk() method to create a list of all files, iterate through the list of files and calculate the md5 hash of each file. Finally, it will create a dictionary entry where the key = md5 hash and the value = filepath.
